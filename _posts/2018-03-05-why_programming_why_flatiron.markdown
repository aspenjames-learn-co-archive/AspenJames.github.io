I have had the pleasure of working in the coffee industry for the last eight years, and while I've loved the work that I do, I've hit the end of that path. As I've grown and advanced in my career, it's been harder and harder to find jobs that fit my skills and needs. The truth is that I've gone about as far as I can with coffee, and I'm ready for a change.

Living in Seattle, there are many opportunities available, but most require at least a four year degree. I never finished college, didn't have much interest in going back for an extended period of time, and most definitely could not afford to be in school for about three years while still living in Seattle. Luckily, one of my close friends told me about a really cool coding bootcamp that she was starting from Flatiron.

Since I'm somebody who likes to do their research, I spent the next week researching different bootcamp options, schools, programs, and even got started coding for free at Codecademy. I was really excited about the possibility to learn at an accelerated pace without the (self-perceived) fluff in most schools. This was what I needed - a program to teach me the exact skills I would need in an exciting new field that didn't take four years to complete. I also had a great time programming! It reminded me of being in high school calculus, writing programs on my TI-84 to do my homework for me. 

I chose the Flatiron program because I liked the format, I liked that I could try the bootcamp prep for free, and I really liked their placement rate for graduates. The learning platform is also integrated with GitHub, so all of my work gets saved there! I made good progress in the prep course, tried to help out when other students had a question, and I was finally ready to take the plunge. I got my acceptance email the day after my Skype interview and got started right away! The experience has been even better than I expected, and the support structures in place are amazing. 

I'm really looking forward to learning more languages, functions, and applications of programming. I'm still a baby programmer, but I'm starting to see how all of the pieces fit together and how I can use these skills in real-life applications. I even sometimes find myself thinking about a program I was working on later in the day and having epiphanies about how I can make it work better. My goal in the next couple weeks is to learn enough to start collaborating on Linux development. The world of free and open-source software is extremely interesting and exciting to me, and I really would love to be a part of it.
