I recently removed Windows completely from my life - the software kind, not the glass-in-the-wall type. This was a very intentional and purposeful choice for me, and I'd like to share a bit about why I made that choice. It's not a decision I made overnight, and am I trying to steer everyone away from the technologies they may be using - I'm simply sharing my experience in hopes that someone may find it useful.  
 
## The Start 
 
When I started my programming journey at the beginning of this year, I very quickly found out that the development tools I needed were (massively) easier to utilize on a Unix-type operating system. This left me with a few choices, the easiest being buying an Apple computer or using a GNU/Linux type operating system. I wasn't quite ready to ditch Windows entirely. This led me to  learning about virtual machines, and I instantly fell in love. The idea of running an entire system within another was just _so cool_. In addition, this allowed me to stay in the environment I knew and was comfortable with while I learned how to use an entirely different operating system experience. I chose the official [Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) "flavor" of Ubuntu, as this seemed like a good fit for me, and all of the tools I needed would work easily with the dpkg/apt package manager.  
 
## Dual-booting 
 
Fairly soon, I understood that running a system on a [hypervisor](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3243262/virtualization/what-is-a-hypervisor.html) meant a fairly large strain on hardware resources. Also the combination of my high resolution screen and the virtual machine meant that things were not always displayed optimally. In short, I wanted the experience of running my development OS directly on my hardware. You can read more about that process [here](http://aspenj.com/linux_on_modern_laptops).  
 
## Free and Open-Source Software 
 
Free and open-source software, often abbreviated FOSS, is the idea of creating software and tools in the open. The code base is available to read, edit, and redistribute by the user, contingent on the specific license used. You can read more about FOSS [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), but the takeaway for me is that FOSS is just a better way to live. That is my personal opinion, and I know several people who prefer proprietary software, and that's okay! Just because I prefer one way of doing things doesn't mean it's the only way. Being exposed to and participating in the FOSS community has helped me shape my values and ideals around what it means to create and produce software, and it fit in well with the personal values I hold. These values and ideals led me to shift away from using proprietary software.  
 
## But you paid for Windows 10 already 
 
Microsoft already has my money, and there's nothing I can do about that. However, they don't need to have my data. Windows 10, along with many other proprietary software, includes a bunch of telemetry reporting. This means that information about me and how I'm using my computer is being broadcast to Microsoft as long as I'm using their software. I didn't like this idea. I like to be in control of who has my data and what they do with it. I know this is pretty much impossible, but I can take steps in that direction. By removing Windows from my machines, I've removed all possibilities of Microsoft collecting my data in that way.  
 
## But what about the programs I use? 
 
There is an ever increasing amount of FOSS alternatives to proprietary software and programs! As it stands, I don't have much use for Microsoft office suite to begin with, so that was not missed. However, I know many people use software for editing music, photos, and things of the like. I haven't explored the options much as I don't personally use software like that, but I've read how FOSS alternatives to these technologies can be equally (if not more) powerful than proprietary versions. I'd recommend reading up on alternatives for your favorite software and trying them out in a virtual machine - you've got nothing to lose! There may be a learning curve, as there was for me navigating a Unix-type system, but there is a ton of support, tutorials, and forums - FOSS is a community!  
 
The interface for a lot of beginner-friendly (though no less powerful) distros such as Ubuntu is shifting away from being very terminal and command-line heavy to having user-friendly graphical tools such as a software center. You could, in theory, install Ubuntu on your machine and never have to touch the terminal or know anything about Unix commands, though I would encourage you to explore! I was pretty unfamiliar and somewhat afraid of the terminal early on, but I now love it. Some operations are simply faster through the terminal, and this made life easier.   
 
## Pop!\_OS 
 
One of the final things that pushed me to switch away from proprietary software entirely was finding a Linux distro that I really enjoyed using. For me, it was [Pop!\_OS](https://system76.com/pop). This is a distro based on Ubuntu (which I already knew how to use!) built by System76 - a hardware manufacturer that makes laptops and desktops built specifically for Linux. Pop gave me the operating system I wanted to use in a really polished and aesthetically pleasing package. Its theme and user interface really clicked with me, and it didn't have much hardware resource overhead -  I was hooked instantly. In the end, finding an operating system that works for you is about discovering the features, interface, and _feel_ you want. For some people, this is a very minimal system that will just _get out of the way_ and let you work. For others, it may be slick window animations and a really modern look and feel. There's no right or wrong way to do it, and that's part of what I love.
